# Wordle Solver

Wordle Solver is a python based application to help solve [Wordle puzzles](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). Using a pre-defined dictionary, it calculates w score for each word based on the prevalence of letters in that word, suggests the highest scored word (currently `arose`), and prompts the user for results of playing that word. Then it refines the suggestion based on inputs.

## Dictionary.txt
Words in the dictionary.txt file taken from https://wordfind.com/length/5-letter-words/. Thank you, to who ever put that together.

## Use
1. From the command line, run `python wordleSolver.py`. 
2. When prompted, enter the suggested word.
3. The application will then ask you for the new pattern of correct letters, followed by the list of letters which do not appear in the words (grey letters in Wordle). Currently, incoorectly placed letters are not supported.
4. Repeat process until you have the solve, then kill the application with `ctrl+C`

## TODO
1. Boot up time takes a while. Cache the dictionary and weighted word list to save time.
2. Make the application stateful so you don't have to reenter all the excluded letters again every time.
3. Handle yellow letters from Wordle; those that are present but in the wrong position.
